# St. Jude cis-X

Search for activating regulatory variants in the tumor genome
<!-- /dx-header -->

Activating regular variants usually cause the cis-activation of target genes.
To find cis-activated genes, allelic specific/imbalance expressions (ASE) and
outlier high expression (OHE) signals are used. Variants in the same
topologically associated domains with the candidates can then be searched,
including structural variants (SV), copy number aberrations (CNA), and single
nucleotide variations (SNV) and insertion/deletions (indel).

A transcription factor binding analysis is also done, using motifs from
[HOCOMOCO] v10 models.

cis-X currently only works with hg19 (GRCh37).

## Inputs

  * `sample-id`: The sample ID. This is primarily used as the prefix for the
    filenames of the results.

  * `results-dir`: The output directory. See "[Outputs](#outputs)" for the
    resulting files.

  * `markers`: A list of single nucleotide markers. This is a tab-delimited
    file with the following columns:

      * `Chr`: chromosome name for the marker
      * `Pos`: genomic start location for the marker
      * `Chr_Allele`: reference allele
      * `Alternative_Allele`: alternative allele
      * `reference_tumor_count`: reference allele count in the tumor genome
      * `alternative_tumor_count`: alternative allele count in the tumor genome
      * `reference_normal_count`: reference allele count in the matched normal genome
      * `alternative_normal_count`: alternative count in the matched normal genome

    This file can be generated with Bambino.

  * `cnv-loh`: CNV/LOH regions. It contains all the genomic regions carrying
    copy number variations (CNV) or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which will be
    filtered out during analysis.

    This is a tab-delimited file in the bed format. It must have at least the
    following three columns:

      * `chrom`: chromosome name
      * `loc.start`: genomic start location
      * `loc.end`: genomic end location

    If no CNV/LOH are in the genome under analysis, a file with no rows (but
    including headers) can be provided.

    This file can be generated with CONSERTING.

  * `bam`: The RNA-Seq BAM file aligned to hg19 (GRCh37). The index file is
    expected to be in the same directory with the same name and extension
    `.bai`, e.g, `/path/to/SJ001_D1.bam` and `/path/to/SJ001_D1.bam.bai`.

    StrongArm or STAR can be used for RNA-Seq alignment.

  * `fpkm-matrix`: A gene expression table. This is a tab-delimited file
    containing gene level expressions for the tumor under analysis. The
    expressions are in FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million

    This file can can be generated with the output of HTseq-count
    preprocessed through `src/other/mergeData_geneName.pl`. The data must be
    able to match values in the given gene specific reference expression
    matrices (see [cis-X ref-exp]) generated from a larger cohort.

  * `snv-indel`: Somatic SNV/indels. This is a tab-delimited file containing
    somatic sequence mutations present in the genome under analysis. It includes

    The file must have the following columns:

      * `chr`: chromosome name
      * `pos`: genomic start location
      * `ref`: reference allele genotype
      * `mutant`: mutant allele genotype
      * `type`: mutation type (either `snv` or `indel`)

    Note that the coordinate used for an indel is after the inserted sequence.

    If no SNV/indels are in the sample under analysis, a file with no rows
    (but including headers) can be provided.

    This file can can be created with Bambino and then preprocessed using the
    steps taken in "[The genetic basis of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia][22237106]".

  * `sv` Somatic SVs. This is a tab-delimited file containing somatic-acquired

    and `-` for a antisense or non-coding strand.

    If no somatic SVs are in the sample under analysis, a file with no rows (but
    including headers) can be provided.

    This file can be generated by CREST.
